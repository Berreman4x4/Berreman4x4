PDF files are automatically generated thanks to the Makefile. 

PDF drawings are generated from IPE by: 
$ ipetoipe -pdf file.ipe

UML diagram was generated with AutoDia at first
$ autodia -i Berreman4x4.py -l python -o UML-auto.dia
and then manually rearranged and corrected with Dia, leading to file "UML.dia".
For the Latex build, UML.dia is exported automatically to PDF with: 
$ dia -t pdf UML.dia
The resulting PDF is then cropped with PDFCrop (see Makefile).
