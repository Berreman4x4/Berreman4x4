Source code for the documentation
-----------------------------

Compilation of the LaTeX source with `make` produces file [documentation.pdf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/berreman4x4/files/documentation.pdf).
A copy is hosted on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/berreman4x4) since GitHub does not provide storage for binaries anymore.
