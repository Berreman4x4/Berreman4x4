\section{Reflection on an interface}
This is the  simplest case as shown on figure ~\ref{fig:Reflection-interface}. A wave is reflected and refracted by an interface. This interface is characterized by the  transmission and reflection power coefficient. See source code for further details.

\section{Bragg Mirror}
Figure ~\ref{fig:Bragg} represents a Bragg mirror with two layers. Each layers is composed of two thin dielectric layers : SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$. An incident wave, its reflecteds waves and its transmitted wave are represented. Bragg mirrors are used to produce ultra-high relfectivity. This example is used to draw the global reflection power coefficient for all layers depending on the wave length. See source code for further details.

\section{Cholesteric liquid crystal}
The structure of a cholesteric crystal is helical. The director vector is rotated.
